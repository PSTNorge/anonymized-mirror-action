# Anonymized Repository Mirroring
Mirror an anonymized version of a branch to another repository.

_For this action to work it needs write access to the remote destination repository. If your remote repository is hosted on GitHub, we recommend adding the SSH-key (public) as a [deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys) in the remote repository._

## Inputs

### `ssh_private_key`

**Required** The SSH key used when pushing to the destination repository.

### `destination_git_url`

**Required** URL of the remote destination repository.

### `annon_name`

The name all commits (both committer and author) will be rewritten to use. Default: `annon`

### `annon_email`

The email all commits (both committer and author) will be rewritten to use. Default: `annon@nowhere.tld`

### `mirror_branch`

The branch to mirror. Default: `main`

## Example usage
